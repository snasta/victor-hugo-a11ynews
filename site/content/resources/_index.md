I set up this website to curate content that I find interesting.  I have multiple professional hobby interests and wanted a site to keep my links and notes for those interest.

Websites that I contribute to:

* [Microassist](https://www.microassist.com):   Founded Microassist in 1988.   We started as a software training company, about the time Michael Dell started selling computers in Austin.  We've evolved into a development company--we develop applications and learning.   We have also developed strong expertise in helping our clients make their digital assets accessible--comply with Section 508, WCAG.
* [Elearning Council](http://www.elearningcouncil.com)
* [AroundAustin](http://www.aroundaustin.com)
* [Gizmohound](http://www.gizmouhund.com)
* [GadgetGuys](http://www.gadgetguys.com)

Photography is a hobby.  I still haven't decided if I like the gear or the photography.   Perhaps both.  I will say that recently the focus has been on family and Microassist rather than hobbies--I've become a lot worse photographer over the last few years.  A few places you can see a bit of my photography.

* [Instagram-Personal](http://instagram.com/snasta):  My personal Instagram account
* [Instagram-AroundAusting](http://instagram.com/aroundaustin):   Photos focused on the city I live in and love.  Occasional photos of day trips.
* [Instagram-Gizmohound](http://instagram.com/thegizmohound):  I think I got my love of gadgets and gizmos from my dad.   It continues on to this day and I think the kid is developing the same interest.
* [Instagram-Microassist](http://instagram.com/microassist):   Photos of life at Microassist.
* [Tejas Studio](http://www.tejasstudio.com):  Cool domain name.  It's a Wordpress site and I haven't had time to keep it updated.   Funniest comment on the site was, it's named Tejas, you need photos of cowboy boots.  Haven't done that yet.

I love sharing useful content.   You can find quick content share on Twitter at:

I have an interest in Entrepreneurship and Education.   Two organizations that reflect that interest are:
