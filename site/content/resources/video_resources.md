* [Guidelines for Audio Description (The Audio Description Project)](http://www.acb.org/adp/guidelines.html)
* [Berkeley Web Access's "About Audio Description" Page](https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/audio-description) (good, simple guide)
* [508 Accessible Videos - How to Make Audio Descriptions](https://digital.gov/2014/06/30/508-accessible-videos-how-to-make-audio-descriptions/)
* [3Play Media's Ultimate Guide to Audio Description](https://www.3playmedia.com/resources/popular-topics/audio-description/) (note: this is a commercial service, but much of the information is usefulâ€¦if you can get past the many "images of text" on the website)
* [WGBH Media Access Group Description Narrative for TV, Films, and Web-base Video (PDF)](http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/pdfs/wgbh_descriptive_narration.pdf) (another service offering, but still a good intro)
* [Web Accessibility Tutorials - Production options for audio descriptions](https://www.w3.org/2017/04/xsmedia-tute/page6.html)
* [YouDescribe](https://youdescribe.org/unsupported-browser) (a service encouraging users to add audio description to existing YouTube videos)
